Text Book:
1. Learning Three.js - the JavaScript 3D Library for WebGL (second edition); ISBN: 978-1-78439-221-5; Author: Jos Dirksen;

DESCRIPTION: 
Animation Tab 1:
* I have drawn a cube with bulge on all faces which has 3 dimensional properties.
* Additional 20 points: This also has some texture mapping and/or some shading.
* This has zoom in/ zoom out properties (scrolling) and 3 dimensional properties (click and drag).

Animation Tab 2:
* This will create arbitary (general) polygons.
* You can set the number of sides for the polygon, Radius from center and Height.
* You've DRAW(draws polygon for the mentioned values) and CLEAR(sets values to original) buttons.
* This has zoom in/ zoom out properties (scrolling) and 3 dimensional properties (click and drag).

DESCRIPTION: 
Animation Tab 1:
* I have drawn a line with changing colors (on Refresh) which has 3 dimensional properties.
* This has zoom in/ zoom out properties (scrolling) and 3 dimensional properties (click and drag).
* This has x,y and z values.

Animation Tab 2:
* I have drawn a set of lines with changing colors (on Refresh) which has 3 dimensional properties.
* This has zoom in/ zoom out properties (scrolling) and 3 dimensional properties (click and drag).
* The number of lines to be drawn can be set manually in the program.
* This has x,y and z values.

Animation Tab 3:
* I have drawn two faces of pyramid thta has 4 points and changing colors (on Refresh) which has 3 dimensional properties.
* I imagined the last image under question 2 and it looks like a 3 dimensional pyramid.
* I've drawn the two sides of the Pyramid. i.e Front and left.
* This has x,y and z values.

3. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10039679/how-can-i-calculate-the-area-of-a-bezier-curve

DESCRIPTION:
* I have done research on this - how to do.
* Due to lack of time, i could not implement/modify this.
* This has the concept of Bézier curve which has led to the Bézier surfaces.
* This has control points to modify the curve.
* It calculates the area accordingly.
