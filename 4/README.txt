*****BASIC REQUIREMENTS*****
-> Requires active internet connection 
-> Tested on Firefox & Microsoft edge browser
-> Open "index.html" file to execute the application

*****FEATURES INCLUDE*****
-> The home page has multiple tabs, on click of each tab, respective links and details will be provided
-> The TREE image of the Geometric Projections has been put up on the Homepage
-> 8 Different types of Planar Geometric projections are drawn under two different tabs with full explaination about each projection
-> There is a 3D Transformations tab where you can view 3D images of my dream house i.e., FrontView, SideView, TopView and IsometricView
-> I have used CSS style sheet, JS page, SCSS and other sources that were available online for the tabular menu under perspective and Parallel tabs
-> For the animated tabular menu, you have a button to go back. On clicking different tabs, they will get highlighted. A link is provided on each animated tab where you can view the separate Geometric Projections
-> I have drawn vanihsing points for a one-point perspective plane. I have also explained about the vanishing points
-> A separate tab has been created for the Oblique Projections where two different types of Oblique Projections are drawn. An explaination is given about the Oblique Projections
-> In the Creativity tab, you can view a full 3D Cube. All the Geometric Projections can be imagined with the 3D cube that is drawn

*****DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS*****
-> SVG drawing area is 350*350 pixels
-> 0,0 is from the upper left of the screen
-> You can operate multiple tabs

*****ADDITIONAL FEATURES*****
-> I have tried to implement the tabular menu under Parallel and Perspective tabs which will make it INTERACTIVE and ATTRACTIVE
-> I have used a data structure to save the points
-> I have done the 3D projections
-> There is an option to go back to the Homepage by clicking on the Main Menu link provide at the end of page
-> You can send an email to the AUTHOR by clicking on his name at the bottom-left corner of the screen

*****LEARNING DURING ASSIGNMENT*****
