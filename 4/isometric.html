            <h3 style="text-align:justify"><samp>An isometric view of an object can be obtained by choosing the viewing direction such that the angles between the projections of the x, y, and z axes are all the same, or 120 degree. For example, with a cube, this is done by first looking straight towards one face. Next, the cube is rotated "+" or "-" 45 degree about the vertical axis, followed by a rotation of approximately "+" or "-" 35 degree about the horizontal axis. Note that with the cube (see image) the perimeter of the resulting 2D drawing is a perfect regular hexagon: all the black lines have equal length and all the cube's faces are the same area. Isometric graph paper can be placed under a normal piece of drawing paper to help achieve the effect without calculation.</samp></h3>
            <h3 style="text-align:justify"><samp>Another way isometric projection can be visualized is by considering a view within a cubical room starting in an upper corner and looking towards the opposite, lower corner. The x-axis extends diagonally down and right, the y-axis extends diagonally down and left, and the z-axis is straight up. Depth is also shown by height on the image. Lines drawn along the axes are at 120 degree to one another.</samp></h3>
