-> Web page opens a home page and after clicing on "SVG TRANSFORMATIONS" link you can view the preview of the House (Frontview, SideView ,TopView)
-> I have divided the page in to 3 quadrants as Front view, Side view and Top view
-> You can perform operations like Translate, Rotate, Scale and Shear

*****ADDITIONAL FEATURES*****
-> I have tried to implement progress bar which aids in INTERACTIVE input to the user
-> I have used a data structure to save the points
-> I attempted for 3D projections
-> 2D transformations are 3D-ready for next iteration

*****LEARNING DURING ASSIGNMENT*****
-> Watched youtube videos and lecture videos for reference
-> I did research online for SVG tutorials
-> Few Links include http://www.w3schools.com/svg/svg_rect.asp
-> And many other random links that were helpful to understand the concepts
